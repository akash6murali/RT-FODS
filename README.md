# Rail Track - Foreign Object Detection System (rt-fods)
The primary goal of this project is to develop a robust Rail Track Foreign Object Detection System
capable of identifying foreign objects, such as stones, rods, or any other potentially hazardous
items, on rail tracks. 

## Features
1. Two-Fold Approach:
Two stages of our approach: binary semantic segmentation to extract rails and an autoencoder for anomaly detection.
2. Real-World Data Integration:
Our System leverages a diverse and realistic dataset extracted from YouTube videos, annotated to mark the presence and location of foreign objects.
3. Comprehensive Anomaly Labeling:
Annotated the dataset to mark the presence and location of foreign objects, including stones, rods, or potential hazards, ensuring comprehensive training and evaluation.
4. Dynamic Environment Adaptability:
Developed the system to effectively adapt to dynamic rail track environments, considering factors such as varied lighting conditions, shadows, and occlusions.
